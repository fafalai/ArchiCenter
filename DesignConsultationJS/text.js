var DesignConsultation1 = "This Design Consultation Report (‘Report) provides independent advice from an Archicentre " +
    "Australia architect – being a registered architect – on the feasibility of your new home, home renovation, improvement " +
    "ideas or multi-unit proposal, to enable you to make an informed decision about whether and how to proceed. ";

var DesignConsultation2 = "The Report is a summary of your discussion with your architect, of likely project requirements " +
    "and objectives with respect to the existing home and/or site, budget and possible regulatory issues. It is not intended " +
    "to provide a detailed assessment of the condition of your property, the scope or cost of any necessary associated repair " +
    "or remedial works, the design potential of your property, or a design solution. ";

var DesignConsultation3 = "Archicentre Australia offers a number of services that can assist in this regard, including a " +
    "New Home or Renovation Feasibility Report (which are a natural extension of this service), Property Assessment and " +
    "Timber Pest Inspections, Expert Advice and Construction Quality Assurance Assessments. These services may also be " +
    "relevant should you decide to sell your property and to buy or develop elsewhere. Please contact Archicentre " +
    "Australia’s offices on 1300 13 45 13 for further details.";

var Where1 = "If you have assessed options and have decided to defer any renovation or development plans, our New Home or " +
    "Renovation Feasibility Report service may be of assistance to you in the future.  Each includes a sketch floor plan, " +
    "section or third dimension image and an opinion of probable cost, which will enable you to:"

var Where2 = "see the possibilities;"

var Where3 = "compare costs;"

var Where4 = "show the proposal to real estate agents, lenders, friends or family; "

var Where5 = "make informed decisions about your future."

var Benefits1 = "Undertaking any renovation or re-building project can be a complex process and few embarking on such a " +
    "project appreciate how complicated it can be. Arriving at the right design (strategically and in detail), setting a " +
    "realistic budget, navigating the planning controls and building regulations and approval processes, selecting materials, " +
    "selecting the right builder/contractor and managing the building contract are just some of the many tasks that are involved, " +
    "with each one requiring specialist skills. Combined they can make for a complicated and time-consuming project if you " +
    "don’t have the right person managing it for you."

var Benefits2 ="You may be still trying to determine which “provider” will best suit your needs, and trying to understand " +
    "the benefits of an Architect, compared with others who offer just drafting services. We would suggest that there is " +
    "no comparison."

var Benefits3 = "It is worth asking any “provider” that you may be considering engaging about the next steps; whether they " +
    "are able and available to carry out all of the required tasks for you and confirming that their qualifications and " +
    "experience support your needs. If they are not able to carry out these tasks or not sufficiently qualified or experienced, " +
    "you may be left looking after significant and complex areas of work on your own.  "

var Benefits4 = "Some people choose a builder or design & build package as it may seem an easier route. Please consider these points:"

var Benefits5 = "Unwittingly, your design is likely to be tailored to the type of construction preferred by that one builder.  " +
    "You may not have the advantage of independent advice about different options. Your architect can provide this advice."

var Benefits6 = "You will not have an opportunity to get competitive quotes from different builders based on the same design " +
    "& inclusions.  How do you know if you are paying a reasonable price? Involving an architect can provide you with this " +
    "opportunity."

var Benefits7 = "You may not have the advantage of a person, independent of the builder, checking for the quality that is " +
    "provided for in the building contract. They can, on your behalf, have the authority to instruct the builder to ensure " +
    "that the works are to the standard and quality of contracted specifications and that you get what you are paying for."

var Benefits8 = "You may not have the advantage of a person independent of the builder checking requests for additional " +
    "payments for variations during the build. Engaging an architect can provide you with this service."

var Benefits9 = "The design service may be promoted as free but might be included in the total construction price. When " +
    "you use an architect, their fees and the build costs are separate so you know what you are paying for and can compare " +
    "quotes for the total construction price."

var Benefits10 = "Even with a simple project such as a verandah or carport, it may appear that design input is limited " +
    "until statutory matters come to the fore; with a renovation, addition or new home, if you don’t make the most of " +
    "your opportunities you could be living with a mistake for a long time.  "

var Architects1 = "Architects – and in particular Archicentre Australia architects – offer a comprehensive range of services " +
    "in connection with the design and construction of buildings. They are the most highly qualified professionals in the building " +
    "industry and independently represent their clients’ interests throughout the architectural design, documentation  and " +
    "construction process. In order to practise, an architect is required by law to:"

var Architects2 = "complete a 5-year course of tertiary study approved by the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia;"

var Architects3 = "accrue at least 2 years of supervised post-graduate industry experience;"

var Architects4 = "successfully complete written and oral examinations;"

    'building permit/approval application.'

var BuildingSurveyor1 = 'Issue the building permit/approval and check the construction documentation for compliance with ' +
    'the National Construction Code.  Carry out on-site checks at major milestones during the build, such as completion of ' +
