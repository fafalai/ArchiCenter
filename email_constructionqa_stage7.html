      <strong>The Report - Stage 7 - Pre-handover</strong>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      The Report will have noted a number of items that require attention - then assisting you with completion on site. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unrestricted access to all parts of a property is in practice seldom available at the time of assessment but the report
        is prepared with care and diligence within the limits of available access. If parts of the property have been noted
        as being inaccessible during the assessment, it is important that you contact the architect and arrange for a second
        assessment when access to restricted areas has been made available. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please note that a charge will be made for a re-assessment depending on the time taken. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Maintaining your home is an important part of home ownership. The Property Maintenance Guide has been included with
        your Report to assist you in developing a maintenance routine for your property. Your Report will have noted items
        that are in need of attention. Failure to attend to maintenance items in a timely manner may reflect the integrity
        and value of your property. Remember, home maintenance is your responsibility. </li>
      <li>We suggest that you seek ongoing assistance from the assessing architect to ensure that the work is carried out in
        a satisfactory manner. </li>
      <li>Please note that the assessment does not include enquiries of Councils or statutory authorities. Non-compliant building
        work is the legal responsibility of the owner of the property. We recommend that you request copies of all appropriate
        permits, approvals and compliance certifications, or ensure that the process to obtain these be undertaken and completed
        by the vendor, prior to the purchase of the property. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to carry out this service and we hope you will take advantage of our ongoing
      services.
    </p>


    <p>Best wishes,
      <br/>
