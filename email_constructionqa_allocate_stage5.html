    <p>Dear XXX_CUSTFIRSTNAME,</p>

    <p>
      <font color="red">Booking Number and Assessment Address:</font> XXX_BOOKINGCODE at
      <strong>XXX_PROPADDRESS1, XXX_PROPCITY</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <font color="red">Type of Report:</font> Construction Quality Assurance Assessment, Stage 5 </p>

    <p>We are pleased to confirm your booking with
      <strong>
        <em>Archicentre Australia</em></strong>. Thank you for your payment.</p>

    <p>All
      <strong>Archicentre Australia</strong> services are undertaken in accordance with the
      <strong>Archicentre Australia</strong> scope, and terms and conditions. If you haven't already looked at these, you can find
      them by clicking
      <a href="https://www.archicentreaustralia.com.au/resources/scope-and-terms-conditions/">here</a>. 
      We recommend you read these thoroughly before you meet with your architect as they clearly outline what to expect. If you have any problems accessing this information, please give
      us a call on
      <strong>1300 13 45 13</strong>.</p>

    <!-- <p>There are 8 stages of a complete building project. This Construction Quality Assurance (&quot;CQA&quot;) assessment undertaken
      by XXX_ARCHITECTNAME relates to Stage 5 - Services(pre-lining). This assessment is undertaken where common contract
      terms and client/builder obligations are explained.</p> -->

    <p>An authorised Access Authority form is mandatory for all CQA inspections with the exception of CQA Inspection 8 (Maintenance
      Period Expiry). You will need to complete part of this form as indicated, with the other part to be completed by an
      authorised representative of your builder.</p>

    <p>Please note that approval from your builder will be required to allow our architect access to the site. If you have yet
      to enter into a Building Contract, this can be included as a Special Condition of your Contract or alternatively, where
      this option is not available, the enclosed Access Authority Form 
      (<a href="http://www.archicentreaustraliainspections.com/images/QA_access_authority.pdf">click here</a>) can be signed by both parties and returned to our office.</p>

    <p>Please also note that 3 days' notice is required for a Construction Quality Assurance Inspection and that &quot;false
      alarms&quot; will attract a service fee of $175 - we recommend that you advise your builder of these details.</p>
    <p>Finally, please note that areas in excess of 3.0m above ground level can only be visually assessed from ground level
      or a safely erected 3.6m extension ladder. Upper floor areas in excess of 2.7m above ground floor level cannot be accessed
      for inspection by our Architect unless safe access is provided - we recommend that your builder be requested to ensure
      safe access to these areas is available as required. </p>

    <p>Your completed Access Authority form can be scanned and emailed to
      <strong>
        <a href="mailto:office@archicentreaustralia.com.au">office@archicentreaustralia.com.au</a>
      </strong> at your earliest convenience. On its receipt, the architect can be arranged to attend the site.</p>

    <p>If you've got any questions or would like information about our other services, please visit
      <a href="http://www.archicentreaustralia.com.au/">archicentreaustralia.com.au</a> or call us on 1300 13 45 13. We are available between 9:00am and 5:30pm EST weekdays
