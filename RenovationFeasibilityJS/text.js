var archRenoFeasibilityReportText1 = 'An Archicentre Australia Renovation Feasibility Report (‘Report’) is a feasibility study which will explore your property’s potential and provide information to help you to decide whether to proceed with your project and whether to engage your Archicentre Australia Architect for ongoing services.\n\n';

var archRenoFeasibilityReportText2 = 'The presented Report is a response to your project requirements and objectives, and considers your existing home and site, your budget, sustainability and possible regulatory issues.\n\n';

var archRenoFeasibilityReportText3 = 'This Report is not intended to provide the final design solution for your renovation, but to present you with a visual representation of an initial feasibility study. This is intended to help you to re-assess, confirm or clarify your needs.\n\n';

var archRenoFeasibilityReportText4 = 'This Report has been prepared by your Archicentre Australia Architect on behalf of Archicentre Australia – a division of ArchiAdvisory Pty Ltd.';

var archRenoFeasibilityNotes1 ='Further detailed work outside the scope of this Report will be necessary to develop the Design.  The Design will evolve as your needs are explored, assessed and fine-tuned to the point where it will be ready to begin construction documentation.';

var arcRenoFeasibilityNotes2 = 'This further detailed work may also include structural engineering, development/planning consent and/or building construction approval, assessment of ground conditions, energy, asbestos (and other latent factors), as well as other investigations and/or considerations.';

var archRenoApprovals1 = 'The construction of the Design presented in this Report will require a number of statutory or regulatory approvals and/or permits.  If you decide to proceed, further investigation into the nature and extent of work required to make application for these permits will form part of the further detailed work.';

var archRenoApprovals2 = 'This may include obtaining a feature survey of your property, geotechnical (soil) investigations, confirmation of service easements and/or connection points.';

var archRenoApprovals3 = 'You should seek advice from a professional consultant that provides these services - your Architect can assist you in their engagement.';

var archRenoCost1 = 'Construction costs vary considerably depending on the type of construction, duration of the project, ease of site access, type of fixtures and fittings and market conditions.  Completing the work in stages can make the costs more manageable, however this may also increase the total cost of the project.';

var archRenoCost2 = 'Project quality and cost control can best be achieved by obtaining competitive tenders/quotations from a number of reputable builders, based on detailed documents prepared by an Archicentre Australia Architect.  Assistance in cost control may also be improved by engaging a quantity surveyor.';

var archRenoCost3 = 'The figures provided below are in the range of typical costs expected for a project of your type.  (Please note that they are not quotations or estimates but merely broad opinions of the construction costs.)  A more accurate opinion of probable cost will need to be prepared once more detailed drawings have been finalised.  However, the tender process – obtaining quotations from suitable builders, leading to negotiation and the eventual signing of a building contract - is the only way of achieving certainty on price.';

var archRenoCost4 = 'The information below is based on the preliminary information you have provided about your home and site and a preliminary visual assessment.  A detailed analysis of the condition of your home and site features and conditions may affect the likely construction costs.  If you decide to continue with your project and engage your Archicentre Australia Architect, this would be one of the next steps undertaken.';

var archRenoCost5 = 'This broad opinion of Costs is based on the Design presented in this Report.  If the Design changes, the broad opinion of costs may be different.';
