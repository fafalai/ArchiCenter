			Congratulations on choosing Archicentre Australia to assess this property. We are pleased to provide this report which contains
			an assessment of the visual defects and other important strategic advice.
		</p>

			These will provide you with an understanding of the faults detected in the assessed property. It is most important that you
			follow the recommendations in the Property Maintenance Guide and the Health and Safety Warnings.
		</p>

		<p>If you have any queries or concerns regarding the contents of the report please contact XXX_ARCHITECTNAME. For all other
			queries, please contact this office and we will be pleased to assist.</p>

			<strong>The Report</strong>
		</p>

		<p style="margin-top: 0">
			The Assessment Report will have noted a number of items that require repair or maintenance. If you are considering purchasing
			the property, we trust the report may assist you in making allowance in your budget for items that require expenditure
			or; negotiating a better purchase price.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reiterating the advice in the Archicentre Australia Terms and Conditions of the assessment
				<strong>we recommend budgeting a further 5% of the value of the property </strong>over the first five years of ownership to provide a &quot;safety
				net&quot; against unexpected costs that may arise and that this be taken into account when establishing a purchase price. </li>
			<li>
				<strong>We recommend that for items noted as serious faults, specialist advice be obtained prior to the purchase, to clearly
					identify realistic rectification costs.</strong>
			</li>
			<li>Unrestricted access to all parts of a property is in practice seldom available at the time of assessment but the report
				is prepared with care and diligence within the limits of available access.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<strong> If parts of the property have been noted as being inaccessible during the assessment, it is important that you contact
				the architect and arrange for a second assessment when access to restricted areas has been made available.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Please note that a charge will be made for a re-assessment depending on the time taken. Maintaining your home is an important
			part of home ownership. The Property Maintenance Guide has been included with your Report to assist you in developing
			a maintenance routine for your property. Your Report will have noted items that are in need of attention. Failure to attend
			to maintenance items in a timely manner may reflect the integrity and value of your property. Remember, home maintenance
			is the owner's responsibility.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li> If you are planning repairs and maintenance the Professional and Trade Guide in the Assessment Report is intended to assist
				you in contacting the appropriate tradesperson to rectify or report in more detail on defects noted or suspected by the
				assessing Architect.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We suggest that you seek ongoing assistance from the assessing architect to ensure that the best quotes are obtained and
			that the work is carried out in a satisfactory manner.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Please note that the assessment does not include enquiries of Councils or statutory authorities. Non-compliant building
				work is the legal responsibility of the owner of the property. We recommend that you request copies of all appropriate
				permits, approvals and compliance certifications, or ensure that the process to obtain these be undertaken and completed
				by the vendor, prior to the purchase of the property.</li>
		</ul>

			<strong>Possible future cracking</strong>
		</p>

		<p style="margin-top: 0">It is important to note that during prolonged periods of drought, the foundation material around buildings can become dry
			and shrink so that cracks can literally open up overnight at any future time. Do not panic. Refer to the Property Maintenance
			Guide for preventative action or remedial action should future cracks develop.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 0">
			<strong>Balconies and Decks </strong>
		</p>

		<p style="margin-top: 0">We recommend annual assessments of external timber/concrete decks &amp; balconies be undertaken to verify their soundness.
			If in doubt, advice from a structural engineer or building surveyor is essential.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 0">
			<strong>Renovation Options </strong>
		</p>

		<p style="margin-top: 0">In the event that you do purchase the property you may be interested in Archicentre Australia's Renovation Sketch Design
			Feasibility service - typically one of: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Renovation when internal alterations are considered; </li>
			<li>Renovation to ground floor additions &amp; alterations; </li>
			<li>Renovation to ground and first floor additions and alterations. </li>
		</ul>

		<p>Whilst you may not be considering a full renovation for some time, a "Master Plan" can be very useful in a variety of ways.
			In particular, it can help to avoid the expense of short-term improvements that prove unsuitable in the long term, for
			example, upgrading a bathroom that's in the ideal location for a future stair, or building a new deck where a future family
			room would be best.</p>

		<p>We also offer a Home Design Consultation to assist clients in selecting the most appropriate direction for their home renovations
			or redevelopment.</p>


		<p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to carry out this service and we hope you will take advantage of our ongoing
			services.

		<p>Contact our architect XXX_ARCHITECTNAME if you have any queries.</p>
