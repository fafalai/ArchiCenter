    <p>Dear XXX_CUSTFIRSTNAME,</p>
    <p>
      <font color="red">Booking Number:</font> XXX_BOOKINGCODE</p>
    <p>
      <font color="red">Type of Report:</font> Residential Renovation Feasibility Report</p>

    <p>We are pleased to confirm your booking with Archicentre Australia. Thank you for your payment.</p>

    <p>All
      <strong>Archicentre Australia</strong> services are undertaken in accordance with the
      <strong>Archicentre Australia</strong> scope, and terms and conditions. If you haven't already looked at these, you can find
      them by clicking
      <a href="https://www.archicentreaustralia.com.au/resources/scope-and-terms-conditions/">here</a>. 
      We recommend you read these thoroughly before you meet with your architect as they clearly outline what to
      expect. If you have any problems accessing this information, please give us a call on
      <strong>1300 13 45 13</strong>.</p>

    <p>Please be aware that the service may be cancelled without charge prior to the day of the assessment or consultation appointment.
      A cancellation fee of $175.00 is applied should the appointment be cancelled on the day of the assessment / consultation
      prior to the arrival of the architect on-site, after which time the full fee will be applicable.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Before your meet your architect</strong>
      <br/> We've given your architect an overview of your discussion with us to help start the conversation when you meet. Your
      architect will be in touch with you over the next few days to arrange a suitable time to meet. If you haven't heard
      from your architect within three days of this booking confirmation please call us.</p>

    <p>Before you meet it's a good idea to start pulling together some notes on the project. Think about the current issues
      or limitations of your home/site and create a wish list of the things you'd like to include or improve in your new
      home. Don't forget to have a realistic indication of your timing and budget. Are you aware of any limitations or restrictions
      that apply to your property such as heritage, landscape or planning overlays or a covenant? If you have any drawings
      of your property make sure you have a copy available for your architect as they will save time if a measure-up is required.
      A Certificate of Title and associated site plan described thereby will be most helpful.</p>

    <p>There are a lot of things to consider and this meeting is a great time to get a better understanding of the journey you
      are about to embark on. You'll find helpful hints on our website to help you prepare for your meeting.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Your Archicentre Australia Design Report</strong>
      <br/>This Design service is a preliminary feasibility study created to help you to decide how or whether to proceed with
      a project. Your architect will arrange a second meeting to take you through a preliminary plan based on your brief,
      an indication of costs and recommendations on the best way to proceed with your project. This is the starting point
      to help you set your plans in motion. If you proceed you'll need further design development sketches to finalise the
      design, and working drawings and specifications, which are essential for council approval and construction. Your architect
      will talk you through the next stage so you'll understand how the process unfolds. You can always visit our website
      for tips and advice along the way. See theWorking with your Architect document on the home page.</p>
