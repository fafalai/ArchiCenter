var scopeOfInspectionP3 = 'This Report is based on a visual inspection of the condition of the reasonably accessible parts of the property and on the basis of the prevailing structural, soil and weather conditions at the time of the inspection. Prolonged periods of exposure to conditions conducive to pest attack or infestation will increase the risk of such an attack and the damage which may eventuate.';

var inspectionAccessP5 = 'The inspector can only inspect the reasonably accessible parts of the property. It is your responsibility to ensure that the inaccessible parts of the property that can be made reasonably accessible for an inspection are made so, prior to the inspection. If parts of the property have been noted as being inaccessible during the inspection, it is important that you contact the inspector and arrange for a second inspection when access to restricted areas has been made available.';

var inspectionAccessP6 = 'Where access is significantly restricted or existing environmental conditions are noted as being of high or extreme risk of timber pest infestation, the inspector may recommend an intrusive timber pest inspection. An intrusive inspection may involve the removal or lifting of furniture, furnishings, linings, claddings, stored goods etc, and/or the cutting of access holes or traps. As physical disruption or damage may occur, it is your responsibility to provide the property owner’s written permission confirming that Archicentre Australia will not be held liable for any damage caused to the property during the intrusive inspection, or the rectification of such damage, prior to the booking of the intrusive inspection service.

var iSImportantNotesP4 = 'In cases where historic damage from subterranean termites is found it is possible that termites are still active in the locality and may return to the property.

If no written evidence of a termite management system to AS 3600-2000 is provided, a treatment should always be considered to prevent attack.';

var recommendationsText = 'Please Note: The recommendation for future inspections should be viewed as part of a household maintenance program and is independent of any inspections that may form part of a recommended treatment. If a treatment is recommended the treatment should be undertaken without delay. Regular inspections will not prevent future attack by subterranean termites or other timber pests but they will assist with the identification of activity. Detection at the earliest opportunity will allow treatment to be commenced and damage minimised.';
