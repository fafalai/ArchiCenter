    <p>Congratulations on choosing Archicentre Australia to assess this property. We are pleased to provide your Archicentre
      Australia Home Warranty Report which contains information on the visual defects associated with applying for HOW insurance.
      </p>

    <p>Please read the full Report including the related Technical Information Sheets and Guides.</p>
    <p>These will provide you with an understanding of the faults detected in the assessed property. It is most important that
      you follow the recommendations in the Property Maintenance Guide and the Health and Safety Warnings.</p>

      <strong>The Report</strong>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      The Report has been prepared as a visual assessment.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unrestricted access to all parts of a property is in practice seldom available at the time of assessment but the report
        is prepared with care and diligence within the limits of available access.</li>

      <li>Maintaining your home is an important part of home ownership. The Property Maintenance Guide has been included with
        your Report to assist you in developing a maintenance routine for your property. Your Report will have noted items
        that are in need of attention. Failure to attend to maintenance items in a timely manner may reflect the integrity
        and value of your property. Remember, home maintenance is your responsibility. </li>

      <li>Please note that the assessment does not include enquiries of Councils or statutory authorities. Non-compliant building
        work is the legal responsibility of the owner of the property. We recommend that you request copies of all appropriate
        permits, approvals and compliance certifications, or ensure that the process to obtain these be undertaken and completed
        by the vendor, prior to the sale of the property. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to carry out this service and we hope you will take advantage of our ongoing
      services.
    </p>

    <p>Best wishes,
