      Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to assist you with the renovation of your home. Please find attached our architect's
      sketch drawing/s illustrating a proposed strategy. At this stage the effort will be to simply establish an overall
      building/siting plan based upon your brief and budgetary conversation. Broad matters of construction relative to the
      site and relevant regulatory controls can be given statement.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the matter of project cost advice, please refer to the report attached to the drawings.
    </p>


    <p>
      In the current market it would be prudent to expect the construction cost to be closer to the upper end of the above range.
      It would also be wise to allow a 5-10% contingency sum to meet any unforeseen expenses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Should you decide to proceed with the project our architect XXX_ARCHITECTNAME will be happy to prepare a detailed fee proposal
      for your consideration. We strongly recommend that you consider engaging the architect to provide further service given their
      expertise and familiarity with the project.
    </p>


    <p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to carry out this service and we hope you will take advantage of our ongoing
      services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Best wishes,
    </p>
