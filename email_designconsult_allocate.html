		<p>We are pleased to confirm your booking with <strong><em>Archicentre Australia</em></strong>. Thank you for your payment.</p>

		<!-- <p>The architect will contact you shortly to arrange a convenient time to assess the property. Please ensure that - if available - you have the latest copies of the approved building documents on site for the architect to review prior to the assessment.</p> -->

		<p>All services are undertaken in accordance with the <strong><em>Archicentre Australia,</em></strong> scope and Terms &amp; Conditions. 
			If you haven&rsquo;t already looked at these, you can find them by clicking <a href="https://www.archicentreaustralia.com.au/resources/scope-and-terms-conditions/"><font color="red">here</font></a>. 
			We recommend you read these thoroughly before you meet with your Architect as they clearly outline what to expect. 
			If you have any problems accessing this information, please give us a call on <strong>1300 13 45 13</strong>.</p>

		<p>Please be aware that the service may be cancelled without charge prior to the day of the consultation appointment. 
			A cancellation fee of $175.00 is applied should the appointment be cancelled on the day of the consultation prior to the arrival of the architect on site. 
			Should the services be discontinued at any point prior to the presentation of the Design report, a fee will be charged taking into account hours and travel time spent on the project</p>

		<p><strong>Before you meet your architect</strong></p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve given your architect an overview of your discussion with us to help start the conversation when you meet. 
			Your architect will be in touch with you over the next few days to arrange a suitable time to meet. 
			If you haven&rsquo;t heard from your architect within three days of this booking confirmation please call us.</p>

		<p>Before you meet it&rsquo;s a good idea to start pulling together some notes on the project. 
			Think about the current issues or limitations of your home/site and create a wish list of the things you&rsquo;d like to include or improve in your new home. 
			Don&rsquo;t forget to have a realistic indication of your timing and budget. Are you aware of any limitations or restrictions that apply to your property such as heritage, 
			landscape or planning overlays or a covenant? If you have any drawings of your property make sure you have a copy available for your conversation with your architect. 
			A Certificate of Title and associated site plan described thereby will be most helpful.</p>
		
		<p>There are a lot of things to consider and this meeting is a great time to get a better understanding of the journey you are about to embark on. 
			You&rsquo;ll find helpful hints on our website to help you prepare for your meeting.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Your Archicentre Australia Design Consultation.</strong></p>

		<p>This Design service is a preliminary conversation created to help you to decide how or whether to proceed with a project. 
			If in the course of the consultation it becomes clear that a Design Feasibility process is more appropriate, please ask that the Design Consultation service be upgraded. </p>

		<p>An Upgrade form can be made available to you - or your architect may have one on hand. Once completed, 
			we can process payment for the upgrade and the Design Feasibility process will proceed. Your architect will talk you through the next stage so you&rsquo;ll understand how the process unfolds. 
			You can always visit our website for tips and advice along the way. See the Working with your Architect document on the home page.</p>
