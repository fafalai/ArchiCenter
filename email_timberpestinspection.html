			Congratulations on choosing Archicentre Australia to assess this property. We are pleased to provide your Report which contains
			inspection and other important strategic advice.
		</p>

		<p>Please read the full Report including the related Technical Information Sheets and Guides.</p>

		<p>These will provide you with an understanding of the faults detected in the assessed property. It is most important that
			you follow the recommendations in the Property Maintenance Guide and the Health and Safety Warnings.</p>

		<p>This letter also contains important information. Please take the time to read it.</p>

		<p>If you have any queries or concerns regarding the contents of the report please contact XXX_ARCHITECTNAME. For all other
			queries, please contact this office and our customer service staff will be pleased to assist.</p>

			<strong>The Report</strong>
		</p>

		<p style="margin-top: 0">
			The Report will have noted a number of items that require repair or maintenance. If you are considering purchasing the property,
			we trust the report may assist you in making allowance in your budget for items that require expenditure or; negotiating
			a better purchase price.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Unrestricted access to all parts of a property is in practice seldom available at the time of assessment but the report
				is prepared with care and diligence within the limits of available access.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<strong>If parts of the property have been noted as being inaccessible during the inspection, it is important that you contact
				the pest inspector and arrange for a second assessment when access to restricted areas has been made available. </strong>
		</p>

		<p>Please note that a charge will be made for a re-inspection depending on the time taken. Maintaining your home is an important
			part of home ownership. The Property Maintenance Guide has been included with your Report to assist you in developing
			a maintenance routine for your property. Your Report will have noted items that are in need of attention. Failure to attend
			to maintenance items in a timely manner may reflect the integrity and value of your property. Remember, home maintenance
			is your responsibility. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Please note that the assessment does not include enquiries of Councils or statutory authorities. Non-compliant building
				work is the legal responsibility of the owner of the property. We recommend that you request copies of all appropriate
				permits, approvals and compliance certifications, or ensure that the process to obtain these be undertaken and completed
				by the vendor, prior to the purchase of the property. </li>
		</ul>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 0">
			<strong>Balconies and Decks</strong>
		</p>

		<p style="margin-top: 0">We recommend annual assessments of external timber/concrete decks and balconies be undertaken to verify their soundness.
			If in doubt, advice from a structural engineer or building surveyor is essential. </p>

		<p>Thank you for allowing Archicentre Australia to carry out this inspection and we hope you will take advantage of our ongoing
			services.
		</p>


		<p>Best wishes,
			<br/>
